# TeeRex Store

King Shan wants to start a t-shirt business, where he sells t-shirts online.

To run his business, he needs a simple webapp where customers can browse through the catalog of t-shirts, add t-shirts to the shopping cart and checkout the items in the cart.

## Task

Your job is to build a simple UI, which allows a customer to do the following:

1. Browse the catalog on a product listing page
2. Each card should have the image, name and price.
3. Search using free text which is a combination of one or more of the below attributes

   - Name
   - Colour
   - Type

   `Eg. green polo`

4. Filter for t-shirts using specific attributes
   - Gender
   - Colour
   - Price range
   - Type
5. Add one or more t-shirts to the shopping cart
6. View the shopping cart by clicking the shopping cart icon
7. Increase quantity or delete items from the shopping cart
8. Display the total amount in the shopping cart.

## Rules

1. Every t-shirt type has a limited quantity. If the customer tries to order more than the available quantity, an error message should appear.
2. Filter can be applied by itself or on top of the search results.
3. Filters and Search need not be retained on navigation between pages, But the items in the cart should be retained.
4. The mockup provided is only a sample so that you have an indication of what is expected from you. You could choose to go with a completely different user experience. But you will need to ensure that all requirements mentioned in the problem are covered & there should be navigation between screens.
5. All features (search, filter, add to cart etc) should be handled on the client side.
6. There are no API's provided for these features.
7. There is no need to handle pagination.
8. There is no need to implement user registration / login.
